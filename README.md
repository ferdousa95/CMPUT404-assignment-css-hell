# Assignment: CSS Hell

You will skin 3 project gutenberg stories with custom CSS.

# Changes made in gutenberg books

Changed the background to make it look like old paper. Downloaded it from imgur.
Change the color of text to better suit the background image. Add a faint shadow and margins around the text.
For paragraph, use a border and border color that contrast with the background. Add faint box shadow. Because of the border, added a little padding and some margins for the border so that it does not go to the edge of the page.
For image, I took idea from a youtube video on how to make a images look old using CSS.
Reference down below.

You will skin 2 versions of a possible professional homepage for your
self with 2 versions of CSS.
